# Just Install Registry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/just-install/registry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/just-install/registry)

This repository contains the just-install "registry": the list of packages available for
installation through just-install.

## Submitting New Catalog Entries

Fork this repository, make your changes to `just-install.json`, then submit a pull request.

Guidelines to follow:

* Read [this (rough) description of the registry file](docs/registry.md)
* Registry entries are listed in alphabetical order, make sure yours fit with this scheme.
* Prefer unversioned entries: if a software provides an URL to always get the latest installer try
  to use that.
* When an installer combines both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an application, only add the
  required `x86` entry. That is: add both `x86` and `x86_64` URLs only when they actually differ.
* For development libraries: prefer ones compiled with Visual Studio since it's the native toolchain
  on Windows.

:warning: Please also consider adding an update rule for your new entry in the [just-install
updater](https://github.com/just-install/just-install-updater) so that your entry can be automatically
updated whenever a new version of your application is released.

## How To Test Changes Locally

* To test the latest features, you can install the Beta version that gets automatically rebuilt after each commit on the master branch by running `msiexec /i http://beta.just-install.it`
* Run `just-install update` to fetch the latest version of the registry file.
* The registry is saved at `%TEMP%\just-install\just-install-v3.json`
* Make your changes to said file:
  * If you have to update an entry, just change it.
  * If you have to add a new entry, start with a similar one already in the file by copying and
    pasting it.
* Test your changes locally by running `just-install <entry name>`.
* Now copy the file over `just-install.json` in your Git repository and submit a PR.
